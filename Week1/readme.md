***What is Cloud Computing?***

Cloud Computing means storing and accessing the data and programs on remote servers that are hosted on the internet instead of the computerâ€™s hard drive or local server. Cloud computing is also referred to as Internet-based computing, it is a technology where the resource is provided as a service through the Internet to the user.

There are three types of cloud computing service models.
1. IaaS ( Infrastrure as a Service): It offers compute and storage services.
2. PaaS ( Platform as a Service) : It offers a develop-and-deploy environment to build cloud apps.
3. SaaS ( Software as a Service) : It delivers apps as services.

 ***We will discuss the basic basic modules and foundational services of AWS.***

Basic modules consist of the following agenda:

1. Compute - Amazon EC2
2. Network - Amazon VPC
3. Security - AWS IAM
4. Monitoring - Amazon CloudWatch
5. Database - Amazon RDS
6. Storage - Amazon S3, Amazon Elastic File System

***What is Amazon EC2?***

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, provides scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. In which you can add virtual servers as an when needed, reducing the overhead of hardware.

Let's start the lab:

Step 1. Create a Key pairs: goto-> Amazon EC2 console-> network&security-> create a key-pair

Step 2. Launch a Web server instance
